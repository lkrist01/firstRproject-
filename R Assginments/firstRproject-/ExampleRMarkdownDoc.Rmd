```{r setup, include=FALSE} 
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE) #We tell R to display code by default.
```




## R Markdown

R Markdown allows us to both perform and present data analysis in a simple linear format.



## Including code fragments

We can embed pieces of R code as follows:

```{r building a function and a data frame}

# First we create a simple function
f <- function(z) {
  return(5*z^2+z+cos(15*z)+0.3*sin(300*z))
}

# We randomly generate some x
x<-runif(100)
# We set y to be f applied to x
y<-f(x)

# We then put x and y together in a data frame
df<-data.frame(x,y)

```

We can also include code with displayed output.

```{r} 

#Display the top 5 rows of df
head(df, n=5)

```

## Including plots

We can also embed plots. By using `echo = FALSE` we display only the output and not the code.

```{r, echo=FALSE}

# A simple plot
plot(x,y) 

```
.

## Knitr


By clicking the **Knit** button we generate either an HTML, PDF, and MS Word document (depending upon the selected output) which displays our analysis in a highly readable format. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.


```{r, include=FALSE} 
# Setting include=FALSE in this fragment ensures that neither the code nor the output for this particular fragment will be displayed.

plot(x,y)

```
